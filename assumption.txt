A user can have accounts in more than one bank.

Each bank can have multiple branches.

Accounts can be of type Saving, Current, or Term Deposit.

Only Bank users can create or close accounts.

Normal users can deposit, withdraw, and check balance (with limits).

Each account belongs to one bank and one user.

Accounts can be operated by minors or Power of Attorney (POA) holders.

The system supports multiple currencies (for NRI users).

Each user has specific roles and permissions.

The APIs will use basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
