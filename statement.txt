Project Title: Simple User and Account Management System

Problem Statement:
This project is about creating a simple system to manage bank users and their accounts.
Users can have multiple accounts in different banks, and each bank can have many branches.
The accounts can be of types like Saving, Current, or Term Deposit.

The system should allow users to do basic actions such as deposit money, withdraw money, check balance, and close accounts (with some limits).
There are two types of users — Normal users and Bank users.
Each user will have specific roles and permissions to control what they can do.

The system will have REST APIs for users, accounts, and banks — for example, /user, /accounts, and /banks.

The main goal is to create the database, define entities, and perform CRUD operations using these APIs.

POST /api/auth/register — register user

POST /api/auth/login — returns JWT

GET /api/customers — list customers (auth)

POST /api/customers — create customer (role-based)

PUT /api/customers/{id} — update (role-based)

DELETE /api/customers/{id} or POST /api/customers/{id}/deactivate — deactivate/reactivate

GET /api/accounts, POST /api/accounts, PUT /api/accounts/{id}, etc.

JWT expiry, validation rules, password hashing expectations, role & permission model (Admin, Manager, Teller, Customer).
